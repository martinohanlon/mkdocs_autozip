# About

As part of my work on online courses for the Raspberry Pi foundation, I wanted to give people access to download a complete zip of the source content which made up our online courses.

We were already using mkdocs to provide a, free to access, mirror of all our course content, so I decided to create a plugin to automatically zip all the source files used in creating the site.

Many of the images used in the content are hosted externally, so the plugin also needed the ability to download external images and include them in the zip.

It was created by Martin O'Hanlon.

Here is an internally hosted image of him.
